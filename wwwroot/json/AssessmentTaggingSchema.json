The complexity of the decisions to be made, the implications of those decisions, and the level of judgement vary according to role and responsibility.

This information varies in relevance, detail and accuracy. In the health context, evidence is usually high-quality information gained from research, and is therefore more predictable and reliable. Whilst all evidence is information, not all information is evidence. To provide the best possible health care, service provision must be evidence informed. The ways through which an individual health worker implements evidence-informed practice depends on their role and responsibility: from strictly following evidence-based protocols and guidelines, to integrating evidence with experience and individuals’ values according to the circumstances. This domain focuses on the competencies related to the application of the best available evidence from scientific or published research studies to practice; the appraisal and integration of data and information; and the role of the health worker in generating and using information and adapting it to guide quality of care, safety and improvement efforts in the local context.",
